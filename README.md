# firebase_hosting_api_client

A Dart client for the Firebase Hosting API.

[Project Notes](https://enspyrco.notion.site/Firebase-Hosting-API-Client-68ea5adcf42244aea89f3476e61c0d18)

There is the [googleapis](https://pub.dev/packages/googleapis) package with generated Dart code for API clients, autogenerated from discovery docs, however the [firebasehosting.v1 library](https://pub.dev/documentation/googleapis/latest/firebasehosting.v1/firebasehosting.v1-library.html) seems to be missing a lot.

This package uses [googleapis_auth](https://pub.dev/packages/googleapis_auth) to create an autheticated client from a given GCP service account key.  The client is then used to access the Firebase Hosting REST API.
